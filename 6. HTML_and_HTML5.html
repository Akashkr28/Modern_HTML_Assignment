                    <td>In traditional HTML, developers had to rely on a limited set of semantic elements like "div" and "span" to structure the content. While these elements are versatile, they do not convey specific meanings about the content they enclose.</td>

                    <td>HTML5 introduces new semantic elements such as "header", "footer", "article", "section", "nav", and "aside". These elements provide a clearer structure to web documents, making it easier for developers and assistive technologies to understand the purpose of different sections within a page.</td>

                    <td> HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using the "audio" and "video" elements. This eliminates the need for external plugins and provides a standardized way to include multimedia, making it more accessible and efficient.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>HTML lacked a built-in mechanism for dynamic rendering of graphics and visual elements on the client side.</td>
                    <td>
                        HTML5 introduces the "canvas" element, which provides a drawing surface for 2D graphics using JavaScript. This allows developers to create interactive graphics, charts, and visualizations directly within the browser, enhancing the capabilities of web applications.
